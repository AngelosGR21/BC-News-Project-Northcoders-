## Setup

In order for the application to work, we need to create 2 .env files in the root of our folder :

* .env.test
* .env.development

Afterwards we create a variable with the name ***PGDATABASE*** and the value of the name of each database. (See ***setup.sql*** file inside the ***db*** folder)
